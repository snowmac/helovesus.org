        <h1>He Loves Us</h1>

        <p>Welcome! I'm making the assumption that you saw my video and are here in response to the video.</p>

        <p>To recap, the question is where will you go when you die? Heaven or Hell? Most people assume Heaven because you're a good person, you pet dogs, try to do the right thing and sometimes give some money to needy people. Right? Well, lets take a quick quiz to findout if you're a good person: </p>

        <h3>Quiz</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Have you ever told a lie?</li>
          <li>Have you ever stolen anything, regardless of its value?</li>
          <li>Have you ever used God's name in vain?</li>
          <li>Have you ever looked at someone with lust?</li>
          <li>Have you ever hated someone?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I've lied, which makes me a lair, I've stolen some office supplies, which makes me a thief, I've used God's name as a cuss word which makes me a blasphemer, finally I've looked at many people with Lust, which makes me an adulterer at heart</p>

        <p>I'm a lying, thieving, adulterer and blasphemer. That's 4 of the 10 commandments. How are you doing? If you're like me not so good. So held to God's perfect standard is it Heaven or Hell?</p>

        <p>If you choose Heaven, you're fooling yourself, without redemption we're all screwed. If you choose Hell you're right. </p>

        <p>What can we do to be saved? The Bible says that we need to repent and believe that Jesus was risen from the dead. If you do that you will be saved. See Mark 1:15, Romans 10:9. </p>

        <p><strong>I'm Catholic, Mormon, Jew etc.. </strong> You still need Jesus. Nothing you do in this life will earn you eternal life. It is a gift of God. See Ephesians 2:8-9</p>
        
        <p><strong>But I'm such a better person then Hilter or Donald Trump. Isn't it relative?</strong> Great, you never murdered anyone or slept with a pornstar. But look at it this way, if I slide through an intersection in heavy wet snow, going 12 mph over the speedlimit and run a red light. The cop that catches me will not care about the fact I let another driver in earlier, he will not care I was nice to my neighbor and shoveled their driveway. He will evaluate me based on the circumstances. I broke the law and I now have been caught. In the case the traffic, I pay a small fine and get some points, with God, at the end of my life, consisting of good things (petting dogs, being nice) and bad things (cussing, lusting, lying, stealing), God judges us and makes us pay the price which the price of breaking God's law is death (Romans 6:23). </p>

        <p><strong>I follow Buddha, Muhammad, etc... </strong> Great. They're both dead in a grave somewhere. Jesus, where's Jesus' grave? Google will tell you he was buried in the tomb which is now "Church of the Holy Sepulchre". But His body is no longer there. He's alive and He rose from the dead.</p>

        <p><strong>There is no God!</strong> Great. Is there a sky? Do you draw breath? Explain it to me without a creator. Explain it without parrell universes and evolution. How does your body process light into brain signals that in real time allow you drive a car at 90 miles an hour without crashing? </p>

        <p><strong>Why aren't you an atheist? </strong> I've wanted to be an Atheist. It would be so much easier. No accountability. Complete freedom of future and human kind is pointless. I could do anything I want without consequences beyond the present. But the profound evidence for creation and a created is so staggering that I have to have so much more faith in the world, humanity and pure pride not to believe. Let me give you a few examples:
          <ul>
            <li>The major nuclear forces holding atomic structures in place are so fined tuned that any minor decimal change would result in matter sticking to tightly together to allow anything more then a giant blob to form or to lose total cohesion.</li>
            <li>If gravity were off even slighty the massive clups of rocks we call planets, solar systems and stars would either be so dense the entire universe would be in a super massive blackhole or we could not even come together to form anything resembling planets.</li>
            <li>Our planet's orbital tilt and elliptical orbit allows for mild seasons.</li>
            <li>Our planet's position the outter arm of the milky way galaxy that allows us to see out into the universe to be able to observe the vastness of creation. </li>
            <li>Our planet's magnetic field that protects us from the sun's radiation.</li>
            <li>Our planet's atmosphere that allows us to breath and protects us from the sun's radiation.</li>
            <li>Our planet's water cycle that allows us to have fresh water.</li>
            <li>The ability to think and percieve these things</li>
          </ul>
